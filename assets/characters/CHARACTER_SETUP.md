# Enhanced Character Animation System üéÆ‚ú®

## Overview
The player character now features a complete animation system with advanced platformer mechanics and polish effects.

## Animation States

### 1. Idle
- **File**: `idle.png`
- **Description**: Default standing pose when player is not moving
- **Usage**: Plays when the player has no input and is on the ground

### 2. Walk
- **Files**: `walk1.png`, `walk2.png`, `walk3.png`
- **Description**: Normal walking animation
- **Usage**: Plays when moving at normal speed (arrow keys or WASD)
- **Speed**: 8 FPS, loops continuously
- **Audio**: Footstep sounds every 0.4 seconds

### 3. Run
- **Files**: `run1.png`, `run2.png`
- **Description**: Faster running animation
- **Usage**: Plays when holding Shift + movement keys
- **Speed**: 12 FPS, loops continuously
- **Audio**: Faster footstep sounds every 0.25 seconds

### 4. Jump
- **File**: `jump.png`
- **Description**: Jumping pose
- **Usage**: Plays when player velocity is upward (negative Y)
- **Speed**: 5 FPS, does not loop
- **Effects**: Jump particles, light screen shake

### 5. Fall
- **File**: `fall.png`
- **Description**: Falling pose
- **Usage**: Plays when player is falling (positive Y velocity)
- **Speed**: 5 FPS, does not loop
- **Effects**: Landing particles and screen shake on impact

## üéÆ Enhanced Controls

### Basic Movement
- **Movement**: A/D or Arrow Keys (Left/Right)
- **Jump**: Spacebar, W, or Up Arrow
- **Run**: Hold Shift while moving (faster speed + different animation)
- **Inventory**: I, Tab, or Shift+Tab

### Advanced Mechanics
- **Variable Jump Height**: Hold space longer for higher jumps, release early for lower jumps
- **Coyote Time**: 0.1 second grace period to jump after leaving a platform
- **Jump Buffering**: Press jump up to 0.1 seconds before landing
- **Smooth Movement**: Acceleration and friction for better feel

## üéØ Technical Features

### Visual Effects
- **Screen Shake**: 
  - Light shake on jump
  - Medium shake on landing
  - Strong shake when hit by enemies
- **Particle Systems**:
  - Jump particles when taking off
  - Landing particles when hitting ground
- **Sprite Flipping**: Character automatically faces movement direction

### Audio System
- **Jump Sound**: Plays on every jump
- **Footstep Audio**: 
  - Varies timing based on walk vs run
  - Randomized pitch for variety
  - Only plays when moving on ground
- **Hit Sound**: Plays when touching enemies

### Movement Feel
- **Acceleration**: Smooth speed-up when starting to move
- **Friction**: Smooth slow-down when stopping
- **Responsive Controls**: Input buffering and coyote time for forgiveness

## üîß Customizable Settings
All movement parameters are exported variables that can be tweaked in the editor:
- **Speed**: Base walking speed (200)
- **Run Speed**: Running speed when holding Shift (350)
- **Jump Velocity**: Jump strength (-400)
- **Gravity**: Fall speed (900)
- **Coyote Time**: Grace period for jumping (0.1s)
- **Jump Buffer Time**: Pre-input window (0.1s)
- **Acceleration**: Speed of acceleration (10)
- **Friction**: Speed of deceleration (10)

## üé® Visual Enhancements
- Character scaled to 10% of original size for proper game proportions
- Smooth camera following with screen shake effects
- Particle effects for dynamic feedback
- Professional UI with controls panel and enhanced score display

## üöÄ Performance Features
- Efficient particle systems using GPU particles
- Timer-based footstep audio to prevent spam
- Optimized movement calculations
- Smart animation state management

This system provides a modern, polished platformer experience with industry-standard features and smooth, responsive controls!
