# Contributing to Professional 2D Platformer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our 2D platformer game! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Godot 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/) or later
- Git for version control
- Basic knowledge of GDScript
- Understanding of 2D game development concepts

### Development Setup
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/the-Game.git
   cd the-Game
   ```
3. **Open in Godot** and ensure everything runs properly
4. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üéØ How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions
- üêõ **Bug fixes** - Fix gameplay issues or technical problems
- ‚ú® **New features** - Add new game mechanics or systems
- üé® **Assets** - Create new sprites, sounds, or visual effects
- üìö **Documentation** - Improve guides, comments, or README
- üîß **Code quality** - Refactoring, optimization, or cleanup

### Priority Areas
1. **Sound System** - Adding audio effects and music
2. **Animation System** - Sprite animations for characters
3. **Level Design** - Creating new levels and challenges
4. **UI/UX** - Menus, HUD improvements, and user experience
5. **Performance** - Optimization and mobile compatibility

## üìù Code Standards

### GDScript Guidelines
```gdscript
# Use explicit typing when possible
var health: int = 100
var speed: float = 200.0

# Use descriptive variable names
var jump_velocity: float = -400.0  # Good
var jv: float = -400.0            # Avoid

# Comment complex logic
func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
    # Handle horizontal movement
    var direction := Input.get_axis("move_left", "move_right")
    velocity.x = direction * speed
    
    # Apply gravity when not on ground
    if not is_on_floor():
        velocity.y += gravity * delta
```

### Scene Organization
- **Keep scenes modular** and focused on single responsibilities
- **Use consistent naming** (PascalCase for scenes, snake_case for scripts)
- **Group related nodes** for better organization
- **Add comments** in complex scene setups

### Asset Guidelines
- **Pixel art style** - Maintain consistent 16-48px sprite sizes
- **Optimized file sizes** - Use appropriate compression
- **Consistent color palette** - Match existing game aesthetics
- **Proper naming** - Use descriptive, lowercase filenames

## üîÑ Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Create a feature branch** from main
2. **Make your changes** in small, focused commits
3. **Test thoroughly** in Godot
4. **Update documentation** if needed
5. **Submit a pull request**

### Commit Messages
Use clear, descriptive commit messages:
```
feat: Add sound effects for jumping and coin pickup
fix: Resolve enemy patrol boundary detection
docs: Update README with new features
refactor: Simplify player movement code
```

### Pull Request Process
1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Include screenshots/GIFs** for visual changes
3. **Reference related issues** if applicable
4. **Ensure all tests pass** (if we add automated testing)
5. **Respond to review feedback** promptly

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Game runs without errors
- [ ] All controls work properly
- [ ] Collision detection functions correctly
- [ ] Camera follows player smoothly
- [ ] Parallax effect works as expected
- [ ] Score system updates correctly
- [ ] Performance remains smooth

### Testing New Features
- **Test edge cases** - What happens at boundaries?
- **Check compatibility** - Does it work with existing systems?
- **Performance impact** - Does it maintain 60 FPS?
- **User experience** - Is it intuitive and fun?

## üé® Asset Creation Guidelines

### Sprite Requirements
- **Resolution**: Maintain pixel art aesthetic
- **Color palette**: Match existing game colors
- **Animation frames**: 60 FPS for smooth animation
- **Transparency**: Use proper alpha channels

### Audio Requirements
- **Format**: OGG Vorbis preferred
- **Quality**: 44.1kHz, 16-bit minimum
- **Length**: Keep sound effects under 2 seconds
- **Volume**: Consistent levels across all audio
